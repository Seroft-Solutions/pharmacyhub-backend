   - Created `UserAnswer.java` - For storing user answers
   - Created `ExamResult.java` - For storing exam results

2. **Repository Interfaces**
   - Created `ExamPaperRepository.java`
   - Created `ExamAttemptRepository.java`
   - Created `UserAnswerRepository.java`
   - Created `ExamResultRepository.java`

3. **DTOs**
   - Created `ExamPaperDTO.java`
   - Created `ExamAttemptDTO.java`
   - Created `UserAnswerDTO.java`
   - Created `ExamResultDTO.java`
   - Created `ExamStatsDTO.java`

4. **Services**
   - Created `ExamPaperService.java` (interface)
   - Created `ExamPaperServiceImpl.java` (implementation)
   - Created `ExamAttemptService.java` (interface)
   - Created `ExamAttemptServiceImpl.java` (implementation)

5. **Controllers**
   - Created `ExamPaperController.java` for handling exam paper endpoints
   - Created `ExamAttemptController.java` for handling exam attempt endpoints

### Frontend Integration

1. **API Services**
   - Updated `examService.ts` to use real API calls
   - Updated `mcqService.ts` to use real API calls
   - Created adapters for transforming backend data to frontend models

2. **State Management**
   - Created `examPaperStore.ts` for managing exam papers

3. **Removed Mock Data**
   - Removed all mock data in favor of real API calls

### Documentation

1. **API Documentation**
   - Created `EXAM_API.md` documenting all API endpoints

2. **Integration Guide**
   - Created `EXAM_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` to guide developers through the integration process

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints have been implemented:

### Exam Papers
- `GET /api/exams/papers` - Get all exam papers
- `GET /api/exams/papers/model` - Get model papers
- `GET /api/exams/papers/past` - Get past papers
- `GET /api/exams/papers/{id}` - Get paper by ID
- `GET /api/exams/papers/stats` - Get exam statistics
- `POST /api/exams/papers` - Create a new exam paper
- `PUT /api/exams/papers/{id}` - Update an exam paper
- `DELETE /api/exams/papers/{id}` - Delete an exam paper

### Exam Attempts
- `POST /api/exams/{id}/start` - Start an exam attempt
- `POST /api/exams/attempts/{id}/submit` - Submit an exam attempt
- `GET /api/exams/attempts/user/{userId}` - Get user's exam attempts
- `GET /api/exams/attempts/{id}` - Get exam attempt by ID
- `GET /api/exams/{examId}/attempts` - Get attempts for a specific exam

## Database Schema

The following database tables have been created:

1. `exam_papers` - Stores model and past papers
2. `exam_paper_tags` - Stores tags for exam papers
3. `exam_attempts` - Stores user attempts at exams
4. `user_answers` - Stores user answers to questions
5. `exam_results` - Stores results of completed exams

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:

1. **Unit Tests** - For individual components
2. **Integration Tests** - For API endpoints
3. **End-to-End Tests** - For the complete flow

## Next Steps

1. **User Interface Improvements**
   - Add progress tracking for users
   - Implement performance analytics
   - Add study recommendations based on exam results

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Reduce API payload sizes

3. **Extended Features**
   - Add timed practice mode
   - Implement study groups
   - Add discussion forums for questions

## Conclusion

The exam feature has been successfully implemented, integrating the frontend with a robust backend. The feature now supports browsing exam papers, taking exams, and viewing results and progress.
