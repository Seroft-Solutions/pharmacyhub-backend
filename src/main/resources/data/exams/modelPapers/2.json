    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "Which of the following is a common binder used in tablet formulations?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Magnesium stearate",
        "B": "Microcrystalline cellulose",
        "C": "Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)",
        "D": "Talc"
      },
      "answer": "C) Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)",
      "explanation": "Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is commonly used as a binder in tablet formulations because it enhances tablet cohesion. Magnesium stearate (A) is a lubricant, Microcrystalline cellulose (B) is a diluent and disintegrant, and Talc (D) is used as a glidant and anti-adherent."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Which tablet coating is designed to prevent drug release in the stomach?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Sugar coating",
        "B": "Film coating",
        "C": "Enteric coating",
        "D": "Compression coating"
      },
      "answer": "C) Enteric coating",
      "explanation": "Enteric coating prevents drug release in the acidic environment of the stomach and allows dissolution in the intestine. Sugar coating (A) is primarily used for taste masking, Film coating (B) provides a thin protective layer but does not protect from stomach acid, and Compression coating (D) is used to layer two different drugs or formulations."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Tablet hardness is typically measured in which unit?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Newtons",
        "B": "Kilograms-force",
        "C": "Pascals",
        "D": "Milliliters"
      },
      "answer": "B) Kilograms-force",
      "explanation": "Tablet hardness is generally measured in kilograms-force (kgf), indicating the force required to break the tablet. Newtons (A) are used in physics but are not the standard for tablet hardness. Pascals (C) measure pressure, and Milliliters (D) measure volume, making them incorrect options."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Mottling in tablets is caused by:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Uneven distribution of colorants",
        "B": "Excessive compression force",
        "C": "High friability",
        "D": "Low binder concentration"
      },
      "answer": "A) Uneven distribution of colorants",
      "explanation": "Mottling refers to uneven coloration in tablets due to improper distribution of colorants. Excessive compression force (B) can cause capping, High friability (C) leads to powdering, and Low binder concentration (D) can affect cohesion but does not directly cause mottling."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "The process of tablet ejection from the die cavity can lead to which defect if not properly controlled?",
      "options": {

        "C": "Lamination",
        "D": "Sticking"
      },
      "answer": "B) Chipping",
      "explanation": "Chipping occurs when a small portion of the tablet breaks off due to improper ejection. Capping (A) is the separation of the top or bottom layers, Lamination (C) is when a tablet splits into multiple layers, and Sticking (D) happens when the tablet adheres to the punches."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "In the dissolution test, what should be done if S1 stage fails?",
      "options": {

        "B": "Discard the entire batch",
        "C": "Reduce tablet hardness",
        "D": "Increase tablet weight"
      },
      "answer": "A) Repeat with 6 more tablets (S2 stage)",
      "explanation": "If the S1 stage fails, an additional test with 6 more tablets is conducted. Discarding the entire batch (B) is not immediately necessary, reducing tablet hardness (C) is not a standard corrective measure, and increasing tablet weight (D) does not address the issue."
    },

      },
      "answer": "B) Flocculated suspension",
      "explanation": "Flocculated suspensions contain loosely aggregated particles, preventing caking. Deflocculated suspension (A) has dispersed particles with a higher risk of caking, Colloidal suspension (C) has smaller particles in a dispersed system, and Lyophobic suspension (D) is thermodynamically unstable."
    },

      "answer": "D) All of the above",
      "explanation": "Polysorbate 80, Sodium lauryl sulfate, and Sorbitan esters all serve as wetting agents by reducing surface tension and improving dispersion of hydrophobic powders. Therefore, all options are correct."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Which of the following techniques is used for particle size determination in suspensions?",

      },
      "answer": "B) Light scattering method",
      "explanation": "The light scattering method is widely used for precise particle size determination. Sieving method (A) is suitable for larger particles, Thin layer chromatography (C) is used for separation of compounds, and Bulk density test (D) measures powder packing properties rather than particle size."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 11,
      "question": "Which method is used to determine the stability of emulsions?",
      "options": {

        "D": "None of the above"
      },
      "answer": "A) Dilution test",
      "explanation": "The dilution test helps determine whether an emulsion is oil-in-water or water-in-oil. Sedimentation test (B) measures particle settling, Hardness test (C) is for solids, and None of the above (D) is incorrect as the dilution test is valid."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 13,
      "question": "What is the purpose of a flocculating agent in suspensions?",
      "options": {

        "B": "To prevent aggregation of particles into a hard cake",
        "C": "To completely dissolve the dispersed particles",
        "D": "To enhance viscosity and prevent particle movement"
      },
      "answer": "B) To prevent aggregation of particles into a hard cake",
