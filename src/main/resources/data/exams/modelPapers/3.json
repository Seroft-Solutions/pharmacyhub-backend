      "question": "Which alternative test is used to detect endotoxins instead of the rabbit pyrogen test?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) test",
        "B": "Hemagglutination assay",
        "C": "Western blot",
        "D": "Turbidimetric test"
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The LAL test is an alternative to the rabbit pyrogen test and detects endotoxins using Limulus (horseshoe crab) blood cells, which coagulate in response to endotoxins. Why other options are incorrect? Hemagglutination assay (B): Used for blood typing and viral detection, not endotoxin testing. Western blot (C): Used for protein identification, not endotoxins. Turbidimetric test (D): Measures cloudiness in solutions, not specific to endotoxins."
