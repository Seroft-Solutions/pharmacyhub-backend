    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "Which of the following diluents is water-soluble?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Calcium phosphate",
        "B": "Lactose",
        "C": "Microcrystalline cellulose",
        "D": "Starch"
      },
      "answer": "(B) Lactose",
      "explanation": "Lactose is a commonly used water-soluble diluent in pharmaceutical formulations, making it ideal for tablet and capsule formulations. Calcium phosphate (A) is water-insoluble and often used in tablet formulations where solubility is not required. Microcrystalline cellulose (C) is an insoluble binder and filler commonly used in direct compression tablet formulations. Starch (D) is a partially soluble excipient primarily used as a disintegrant rather than a diluent."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Which superdisintegrant is most effective in low concentrations?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Corn starch",
        "B": "Sodium starch glycolate",
        "C": "Talc",
        "D": "PVP"
      },
      "answer": "(B) Sodium starch glycolate",
      "explanation": "Sodium starch glycolate is a superdisintegrant that swells in the presence of water, leading to rapid tablet disintegration. It is effective even at low concentrations (2-8%). Corn starch (A) functions as a disintegrant but requires higher concentrations compared to sodium starch glycolate. Talc (C) is used as an anti-adherent and lubricant but does not function as a disintegrant. PVP (D) (polyvinylpyrrolidone) is commonly used as a binder rather than a superdisintegrant."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "Which of the following functions as a thickening agent in creams?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Carbopol",
        "B": "Glycerin",
        "C": "Lactose",
        "D": "Acacia"
      },
      "answer": "(A) Carbopol",
      "explanation": "Carbopol is a synthetic polymer that acts as a thickening agent in creams and gels, increasing viscosity and improving stability. Glycerin (B) is a humectant that helps retain moisture in formulations but does not function as a thickener. Lactose (C) is a commonly used excipient in tablets but does not play a role in thickening. Acacia (D) is a natural gum used primarily as a binder and emulsifier in pharmaceutical formulations."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "Which parameter is critical in preventing tablet lamination during compression?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Punch penetration depth",
        "B": "Compression speed",
        "C": "Granule moisture content",
        "D": "Tablet thickness"
      },
      "answer": "(C) Granule moisture content",
      "explanation": "Maintaining optimal granule moisture content is essential in preventing tablet lamination. If the granules are too dry, they may not bond properly, leading to delamination. Conversely, excess moisture can cause sticking issues. Punch penetration depth (A) mainly affects the hardness of tablets but is not the primary factor in preventing lamination. Compression speed (B) can influence the process but is not as critical as moisture content. Tablet thickness (D) is influenced by compression force but does not directly prevent lamination."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a type of tablet?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Sustained-release tablet",
        "B": "Lyophilized tablet",
        "C": "Pulsatile-release tablet",
        "D": "Modified-dose tablet"
      },
      "answer": "(D) Modified-dose tablet",
      "explanation": "The term \"modified-dose tablet\" is not a recognized pharmaceutical dosage form. Sustained-release tablets (A) are designed to release the drug gradually over an extended period. Lyophilized tablets (B) are freeze-dried, fast-dissolving dosage forms used for rapid onset of action. Pulsatile-release tablets (C) are designed to release the drug in pulses at predetermined intervals."

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "According to USP/BP, what is the maximum allowable weight deviation for tablets weighing ≥ 250 mg?",
      "options": {
        "A": "±10%",
        "B": "±7.5%",
        "C": "±5%",
        "D": "±2.5%"
      },
      "answer": "(C) ±5%",
      "explanation": "The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and British Pharmacopeia (BP) specify weight variation limits for tablets to ensure uniformity in drug content. For tablets weighing 250 mg or more, the allowable deviation is ±5%. Tablets below this weight have higher permissible deviations. ±10% (A) and ±7.5% (B) are applicable for smaller tablet weights, whereas ±2.5% (D) is stricter than the actual standard."

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question": "Which of the following is an example of a pharmaceutical suspension?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Milk",
        "B": "Calamine lotion",
        "C": "Olive oil",
        "D": "Saline water"
      },
      "answer": "(B) Calamine lotion",
      "explanation": "A pharmaceutical suspension is a biphasic liquid dosage form in which finely divided solid particles are dispersed in a liquid medium. Calamine lotion (B) is a classic example of a pharmaceutical suspension used for skin irritation. Milk (A) is an emulsion, not a suspension. Olive oil (C) is a lipid-based liquid, and saline water (D) is a true solution, not a suspension."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,
      "question": "Which of the following is an example of a thickening agent used in suspensions?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Sodium lauryl sulfate",
        "B": "Carboxymethylcellulose",
        "C": "Tween 80",
        "D": "Polysorbate 20"
      },
      "answer": "(B) Carboxymethylcellulose",
      "explanation": "Carboxymethylcellulose (B) is commonly used as a thickening agent in pharmaceutical suspensions to increase viscosity and improve stability. Sodium lauryl sulfate (A) and Tween 80 (C) are surfactants, not thickening agents. Polysorbate 20 (D) is an emulsifier used in emulsion formulations rather than suspensions."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question": "Which of the following techniques can be used to improve the stability of suspensions?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Particle size reduction",
        "B": "Addition of suspending agents",
        "C": "Use of wetting agents",
        "D": "All of the above"
      },
      "answer": "(D) All of the above",
      "explanation": "Suspension stability can be enhanced by multiple approaches. Particle size reduction (A) increases surface area and helps maintain uniform dispersion. Adding suspending agents (B) prevents sedimentation by increasing viscosity. Wetting agents (C) help disperse hydrophobic drug particles in the liquid medium. Therefore, all three methods (D) contribute to improved stability."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Which of the following can cause flocculation in emulsions?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Addition of electrolytes",
        "B": "High shear mixing",
        "C": "Presence of excessive surfactant",
        "D": "Both (A) and (B)"
      },
      "answer": "(A) Addition of electrolytes",
      "explanation": "Flocculation in emulsions is mainly induced by the addition of electrolytes, which decrease the repulsive forces between the dispersed droplets by neutralizing their surface charges. High shear mixing, on the other hand, tends to break apart flocculated structures rather than cause them. Excessive surfactant generally helps stabilize emulsions. Therefore, the correct cause of flocculation is the addition of electrolytes."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 11,
      "question": "Which of the following surfactants is commonly used in oil-in-water emulsions?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Span 80",
        "B": "Sodium lauryl sulfate",
        "C": "Beeswax",
        "D": "Stearic acid"
      },
      "answer": "(B) Sodium lauryl sulfate",
      "explanation": "Sodium lauryl sulfate (B) is a widely used anionic surfactant in oil-in-water emulsions due to its excellent emulsifying properties. Span 80 (A) is more suitable for water-in-oil emulsions. Beeswax (C) and stearic acid (D) act as stiffening agents rather than surfactants in emulsions."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 12,
      "question": "Which of the following is a potential issue when using natural emulsifiers like acacia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Microbial contamination",
        "B": "Incompatibility with some drugs",
        "C": "Batch-to-batch variability",
        "D": "All of the above"
      },
      "answer": "(D) All of the above",
      "explanation": "Natural emulsifiers such as acacia have several limitations. They are prone to microbial contamination (A) and may require preservatives. They can also be incompatible with certain drugs (B), leading to stability issues. Additionally, their composition varies between batches (C), affecting reproducibility in formulations. Thus, all the mentioned concerns (D) are valid."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 13,
      "question": "Which one of the following is NOT a type of adsorption?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Physisorption",
        "B": "Chemisorption",
        "C": "Ion exchange adsorption",
        "D": "Vaporization adsorption"
      },
      "answer": "(D) Vaporization adsorption",
      "explanation": "Adsorption refers to the accumulation of molecules on a surface. Physisorption (A) involves weak van der Waals forces, while chemisorption (B) involves stronger chemical bonds. Ion exchange adsorption (C) occurs when ions in a solution are exchanged with those on an adsorbent. Vaporization adsorption (D) is incorrect because vaporization is a phase change, not an adsorption process."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 14,
      "question": "A buffer solution resists changes in pH upon the addition of:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Strong acid only",
        "B": "Strong base only",
        "C": "Both strong acid and strong base",
        "D": "Water"
      },
      "answer": "(C) Both strong acid and strong base",
      "explanation": "A buffer solution consists of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid, allowing it to resist pH changes when small amounts of strong acid (A) or strong base (B) are added. Water (D) does not significantly alter the pH of a properly prepared buffer solution."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 15,
      "question": "The term \"dialysis\" in colloidal systems refers to:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Purification of colloids by diffusion through a membrane",
        "B": "Coagulation of colloidal particles",
        "C": "Decreasing viscosity of colloids",
        "D": "Formation of micelles"
      },
      "answer": "(A) Purification of colloids by diffusion through a membrane",
      "explanation": "Dialysis (A) is a process used to purify colloidal dispersions by allowing smaller molecules and ions to diffuse through a semipermeable membrane while retaining the colloidal particles. Coagulation (B) involves the aggregation of colloidal particles, decreasing viscosity (C) is not related to dialysis, and micelle formation (D) occurs in surfactant solutions rather than in colloidal dialysis."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 16,
      "question": "The process of flocculation in colloidal systems leads to:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Increased stability",
        "B": "Particle aggregation",
        "C": "Decreased viscosity",
        "D": "Increased surface area"
      },
      "answer": "(B) Particle aggregation",
      "explanation": "Flocculation in colloidal systems refers to the formation of loose aggregates of particles, leading to particle aggregation (B). This process can be beneficial in suspensions as it prevents the formation of a hard cake. Increased stability (A) can be observed in some cases but is not the primary effect. Decreased viscosity (C) does not always occur, as flocculated systems can maintain viscosity. Increased surface area (D) is incorrect since aggregated particles have a reduced overall exposed surface area."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 17,
      "question": "Which type of emulsion instability can be reversed by shaking?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Cracking",
        "B": "Coalescence",
        "C": "Creaming",
        "D": "Phase inversion"
      },
      "answer": "(C) Creaming",
      "explanation": "Creaming (C) in emulsions occurs when dispersed droplets move to the top or bottom of the container due to density differences. This process is reversible by shaking. Cracking (A) and coalescence (B) are irreversible forms of emulsion instability, where droplets merge and lead to phase separation. Phase inversion (D) is a complete shift of the continuous and dispersed phases and cannot be reversed by simple shaking."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 18,
      "question": "In deflocculated suspensions, the particles:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Form a hard cake upon settling",
        "B": "Settle rapidly and redisperse easily",
        "C": "Remain suspended indefinitely",
        "D": "Float to the top of the liquid"
      },
      "answer": "(A) Form a hard cake upon settling",
      "explanation": "In deflocculated suspensions, particles remain as individual units and settle slowly, leading to the formation of a dense sediment or hard cake (A) that is difficult to redisperse. Flocculated suspensions, in contrast, settle faster but are easily redispersed (B). Particles do not remain indefinitely suspended (C), and they do not float to the top (D) unless they are less dense than the medium."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 19,
      "question": "The formation of large crystals can be promoted by:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Slow cooling",
        "B": "Rapid cooling",
        "C": "Adding impurities",
        "D": "Increasing solute concentration"
      },
      "answer": "(A) Slow cooling",
      "explanation": "Slow cooling (A) allows molecules to align in a structured manner, promoting the formation of large, well-ordered crystals. Rapid cooling (B) results in smaller, less defined crystals. Adding impurities (C) can interfere with crystal formation. Increasing solute concentration (D) may promote crystallization but does not necessarily lead to larger crystals."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 20,
      "question": "The principle of vacuum distillation is based on:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Reducing pressure to lower boiling points",
        "B": "Increasing pressure to raise boiling points",
        "C": "Using a solvent for separation",
        "D": "Crystallization of volatile components"
      },
      "answer": "(A) Reducing pressure to lower boiling points",
      "explanation": "Vacuum distillation (A) works by reducing the pressure within the system, which lowers the boiling points of liquids and allows them to be separated at lower temperatures, minimizing thermal degradation. Increasing pressure (B) raises boiling points, which is not desirable in vacuum distillation. Using a solvent (C) is a principle of solvent extraction, not distillation. Crystallization (D) is unrelated to the distillation process."
    },
    {
      "question_number": 21,
      "question": "The choice of solvent in liquid-liquid extraction is based on:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Polarity differences between solvents",
        "B": "The molecular weight of the solute",
        "C": "The solubility of the solvent in water",
        "D": "The density of the solvent"
      },
      "answer": "(A) Polarity differences between solvents",
      "explanation": "Liquid-liquid extraction relies on differences in polarity between solvents (A) to achieve separation. The molecular weight of the solute (B) is less important than its solubility. While solvent solubility in water (C) is a factor, it is not the primary criterion. The density of the solvent (D) can affect separation efficiency but is not the main factor for solvent selection."

    {
      "question_number": 22,
      "question": "The duration of maceration for the extraction of medicinal plant materials is usually:",
      "options": {
        "A": "A few minutes",
        "B": "1-2 hours",
        "C": "3-7 days",
        "D": "More than a month"
      },
      "answer": "(C) 3-7 days",
      "explanation": "Maceration is a common extraction method where medicinal plant materials are soaked in a suitable solvent for 3-7 days (C) to ensure adequate extraction of active constituents. A few minutes (A) or 1-2 hours (B) are insufficient for complete extraction. Extractions lasting more than a month (D) are rarely necessary."
